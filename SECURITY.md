# Security Policy

`cpp-chess` is a simple project that was originally written for a school assignment.
Security is not a major concern.
If you have found a vulnerability, feel free to publicly report it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/dkareh/cpp-chess/issues) on GitHub.
If you don't want to publicly report it, you can [report it privately](https://github.com/dkareh/cpp-chess/security) through GitHub.
Any vulnerabilities will be fixed as soon as possible.
If you want, feel free to submit a pull request!
I'll try to review and merge it in a timely manner.
