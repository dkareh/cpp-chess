# COP 3003 - Programming II - C++ Chess

## Functionality

Users can play chess and most of the rules are enforced. Users can also choose between three different visual styles.

## Why?

I'm not an avid chess player, but I watch my friends play chess sometimes, and it looks fun! Additionally, the rules of chess are complex enough to be interesting to me.

## Maintainers

- Daniel Kareh ([@dkareh](https://github.com/dkareh))

## To Do

- [ ] Tell players if checkmate or stalemate has occurred.
- [X] Add support for castling.
